# Braintree-Payments-API
API that handles payment (credit card) operations.

This API is consumed by a shoppping cart Mobile Application (IOS), user can select any item in the shopping cart they would 
like to purchase and be able to pay for their order.

In order to pay for their order users can use their credit card, the api uses credit card payment system provided by 
Braintree(https://www.braintreepayments.com).
